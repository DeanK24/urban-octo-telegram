# Code Refactor Starter Code
# <Horiseon-Homepage>

## Description
This is my first coding project in the coding bootcamp. The goal was to was to clean up the code and make sure everything was working on the website such as making sure the application links were working. I built this project to help hone my skills after leaning about HTML and CSS. I learned how to group style attritubute to clean up the CSS page. We were provided with a website that we had to refactor the code to make sure the links inside the webpage were all working. the next biggest problem was just cleaning up the code on the CSS page by grouping CSS selectors that were all using the same functions or rules.
